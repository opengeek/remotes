## Remotes

Remotes is an Extra for MODX Revolution designed to allow a cluster of remote
web nodes to register themselves, send a command to all the registered nodes
in the cluster, and execute those commands on each node.

## Installation

Install via Package Management.

If the existing web nodes have a local cache, make sure you enable Remotes
during installation and then manually remove the contents of the cache
directories on each node.

## Copyright Information

Remotes is distributed as GPL (as MODX Revolution is), but the copyright owner
(Jason Coward) grants all users of Remotes the ability to modify, distribute
and use Remotes in MODX development as they see fit, as long as attribution
is given somewhere in the distributed source of all derivative works.
